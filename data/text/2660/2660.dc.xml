   <description>This article explores the links between wine consumersâ€™ preferences for wine from particular countries or regions and their interest in, and propensity to travel to, specific wine
      regions. Data from a convenience sample of 161 wine consumers in Calgary, Canada, revealed that specific appellation-oforigin preferences (e.g., for Australian or French wines) do have an
      influence on travel preferences and patterns. Nearly 70% of respondents preferred to drink wines from particular origins, and planned wine-related travel by respondents closely matched those
      geographic preferences. Other factors, however, were also shown to be important in shaping wine tourism destinations, including distance and cognitive factors. Implications are drawn for wine
      tourism marketing and for destination-choice theory. Recommendations are made for future research.</description>

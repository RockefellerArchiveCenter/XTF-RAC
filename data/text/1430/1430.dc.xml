   <description>This article traces the trajectory of a commonplace object, the wine-cup in Mughal court culture, using painting as a source. Initially associated with hedonistic pleasure alone, the
      wine-cup came to be represented, in allegories of wineandverse,as alocus fortherealisationof divinereality, having gnostic values. The imagery of mystical intoxication further imbued the
      object with a political meaning, in which the cup became a world in miniature and the wine in it, the elixir of life, thereby legitimising the Mughal monarchy in a cosmological framework of
      universal and immortal rulership. However, the imagery came a full circle, when in the course of the eighteenth century, from its association with male rulership, it came to be exclusively
      associated with female eroticism and pure hedonism.</description>

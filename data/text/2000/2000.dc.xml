   <description>This exploratory study identified specific preferences and characteristics of Korean wine consumers. Relevant literature was reviewed in an attempt to find the most suitable market
      strategy in the Korean wine market. This study employed samples from members of a Korean wine association (KISA) to identify Korean wine consumersâ€™characteristics and preferences. The study
      found Korean wine consumers had interesting preferences and that there were some significant differences between these preferences and demographic characteristics among the Korean respondents.
      The paper offers wine marketers suggestions about what they need to understand in order to attract Korean wine consumers and what may be appropriate and effective wine-marketing strategies and
      practices in Korea.</description>

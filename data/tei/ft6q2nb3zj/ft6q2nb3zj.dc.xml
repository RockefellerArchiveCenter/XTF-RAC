    <description>This is the first ethnographic study of the farmers and foragers of northeastern
      Zaire since Colin Turnbull's classic works of the 1960s. Roy Richard Grinker lived for nearly
      two years among the Lese farmers and their long-term partners, the Efe (Pygmies), learned
      their languages, and gained unique insights into their complex social relations and ethnic
      identities. By showing how political organization is structured by ethnic and gender relations
      in the Lese house, Grinker challenges previous views of the Lese and Efe and other
      farmer-forager societies, as well as the conventional anthropological boundary between
      domestic and political contexts.</description>
